        <p>
          The Serampore Mission of the Baptist Missionary Society was established on 10th January 1800. 
          William Carey had already been in India for 7 years when his first Baptist mission was started 
          in a Danish settlement at Serampore. Serampore College was founded in 1818 with the vision 
          of Joshua Marshman and William Ward, supported by Carey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The College is one of the oldest institutions in India providing higher education in Arts, Science 
          and Commerce streams. Over the last two centuries, it has shaped countless lives with quality 
          education, discipline and moral values.
